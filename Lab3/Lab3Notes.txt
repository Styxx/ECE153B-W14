/*****TASKS*****/

Finish up figuring out how to get the Sin wave to work in Verilog
Once the Sine wave works in verilog this is what we do:
	Turn the verilog into a bigger FSM that chooses between the SinWave state
		and the TriangleWave state. depending on the input of a certain
		varible, it chooses between these states
	Modify counter such that it is able to change dependent on an outside variable
		This is just like changing the period in Lab 2. We can use the same method.
		Changing counter changes the frequency of our wave. Figure out according formula
		(how much do we count to to get a certain frequency?)
	Figure out how to change the amplitude of the wave.
		This changes how high or low we're counting to for Dout.
		Changing the amplitude in the interface, you can only reduce the wave (can't make it
		bigger than +/- 5V, since 5V is the Vref.)
		Figure out how to limit how high and how low Dout go. this will change the relative
		peak-to-peaks of the wave
		
	

Write C code to execute verliog - see sample.c for example
	
	
/* IGNORE THIS SECTION */
	Uses sin() to create variable sin wave output.
	Sin wave created by constantly changing D7-D0 (See pg 7 of TLC7226-DAC.pdf)
		Range from 1111 1111 to 0000 0000:		
		1111 1111				+Vref(127/128)
		1000 0001				+Vref(1/128)
		1000 0000				0V
		0111 1111				-Vref(1/128)
		0000 0001				-Vref(127/128)
		0000 0000				-Vref
	DAC changes these bits to analog signal quickly => Sinwave

/*****DONE*****/
TrigDAC.v -	Write (reuse) verilog similar to Lab2 Pt3 state machine
		Goes according to timing diagram on pg 6 of TLC7226-DAC.pdf?
		Given address 0x10dXXX, latch D7-D0 to DAC chip.
